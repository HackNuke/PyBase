## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, open an issue with the information about it.
This will be resolved over time depending on the severity of the vulnerability,
that is, if it's very serious, it'll take less time to be fixed than a mild vulnerability.

When it's finally resolved, a new version will be uploaded, the patch will be notified and the issue will be closed.
