# Flask example

This is a port of my template repo called [Flask_To-Do](https://github.com/NTBBloodbath/Flask_To-Do) to PyBase.

## Setup

> We assume that you have already installed PyBase, if not, please go to
> https://pybase.netlify.app/guide/installation.html

### Requirements

#### Knowledges

- Basic HTML/CSS/Python knowledge to understand the code

#### Libraries

- PyBase (Latest Development version)
- Flask

---

First, we need to tell Flask where is your flask app located.

```sh
export FLASK_APP=to-do.py
```

After that, we just need to run our flask app and go to `http://localhost:5000/`.

```sh
python to-do.py
```
